# Personal Contact Management Application

This is a simple Personal Contact Management Application built using Laravel for the backend and JavaScript for the frontend.

## Overview

The application allows users to manage their personal contacts. Users can add, delete, and view contacts, with each contact including the following information: name, email, phone number, and an optional note.

## Requirements

### Laravel Backend

- Set up a new Laravel project.
- Use Laravel migrations to create a database table for contacts.
- Develop API endpoints to add, delete, and retrieve contacts from the database.
- Implement validation rules for contact data (e.g., email format, required fields).

### JavaScript Frontend

- Create a simple and user-friendly interface to interact with the backend.
- Implement functionalities to:
  - Display a list of contacts.
  - Add a new contact through a form.
  - Delete a contact.
- Ensure the frontend communicates with the backend API to perform these operations.

### Additional Considerations

- Security: Ensure proper handling of user inputs to prevent common vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, XSS).
- Code Quality: Follow coding best practices and organize your code for readability and maintainability.
- Documentation: Provide a README file that includes instructions on how to set up and run the project, and a brief description of the project structure and any libraries or frameworks used.

## Evaluation Criteria

- Correctness: The application works as described without errors.
- Code Quality: The code is clean, well-organized, and follows best practices.
- Security: The application does not have glaring security vulnerabilities.
- Completion: Strive to complete as much of the project as possible within the given time frame, focusing on core functionalities first.
